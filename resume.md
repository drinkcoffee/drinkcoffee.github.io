# ConsenSys (July 2017 to Present): Technical Directory & Cryptographer

[ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/) is a software development and research company driving the Ethereum ecosystem forwards. I have worked in three main areas at ConsenSys:

**Co-founding of Protocols business unit (PegaSys)**: During 2017 and early-2018 my focus was hiring a team, building culture, establishing processes and creating a world class research & development group. 

**Crosschain & Bridges**: From 2018 onwards, I mainly researched a range of protocols that facilitated cross-blockchain communications. I invented the following protocols:

* General Purpose Atomic Crosschain Transactions (GPACT): Enables composable programming across blockchains. Allows for inter-contract and inter-blockchain function calls that are both synchronous and atomic: if one part fails, the whole call execution tree of function calls is rolled back.
* Crosschain Protocol Stack: Describes how applications, function call, and messaging components can interoperate. 
* Anonymous State Pinning: State pinning approach that preserved privacy of pinned chain.
* Atomic Crosschain Transactions: Provides similar capabilities to GPACT. However, requires changes to blockchain clients to operate.

**Filecoin Secondary Retrieval Market**: In late 2020 and the first half of 2021 I worked with Protocol Labs to determine requirements, architect, and lead a team that delivered a system to allow for massive scaling of the Filecoin system. 

**Other Projects**: In addition to the large projects described above I also did the following smaller projects:

* Stateless Ethereum: Researched how Ethereum could be made *stateless*. My focus area was Code Merklization. 
* Ethereum Private Sidechains: In 2018 I created a technology that allowed on-demand ephemeral, permissioned, private, confidential, dynamic blockchains. Many aspects of this research have become part of Hyperledger Besu's Privacy Group feature.
* Scaling Ethereum and Rollups: I described in 2017 how many blockchains could operated in parallel with Ethereum, leveraging the security of Ethereum MainNet, thus scaling Ethereum.
