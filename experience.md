# ConsenSys (July 2017 to Present): Technical Directory & Applied Cryptographer

[ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/) is a software development and research company driving the Ethereum ecosystem forwards. I have worked in three main areas at ConsenSys:

**Co-founding of Protocols business unit (PegaSys)**: During 2017 and early-2018 my focus was hiring a team, building culture, establishing processes and creating a world class research & development group. 

**[Crosschain & Bridges](../projects/crosschain/)**: From 2018 onwards, I have mainly researched a range of protocols that facilitate cross-blockchain communications. I invented the following protocols:

* General Purpose Atomic Crosschain Transactions (GPACT): Enables composable programming across blockchains. Allows for inter-contract and inter-blockchain function calls that are both synchronous and atomic: if one part fails, the whole call execution tree of function calls is rolled back.
* Crosschain Protocol Stack: Describes how applications, function call, and messaging components can interoperate. 
* Anonymous State Pinning: State pinning approach that preserved privacy of pinned chain.
* Atomic Crosschain Transactions: Provides similar capabilities to GPACT. However, requires changes to blockchain clients to operate.

**Filecoin Secondary Retrieval Market**: In late 2020 and the first half of 2021 I worked with Protocol Labs to determine requirements, architect, and lead a team that delivered a system to allow for massive scaling of the data retrieval system in Filecoin. The architecture for the system is described here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NUfUHRbCFs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NUfUHRbCFs).

**Other Projects**: In addition to the large projects described above I also did the following smaller projects:

* Stateless Ethereum: Researched how Ethereum could be made *stateless*. My focus area was Code Merklization. 
* Ethereum Private Sidechains: In 2018 I created a technology that allowed on-demand ephemeral, permissioned, private, confidential, dynamic blockchains. Many aspects of this research have become part of Hyperledger Besu's Privacy Group feature.
* Scaling Ethereum and Rollups: I described in 2017 and 2018 how many blockchains could operated in parallel with Ethereum, leveraging the security of Ethereum MainNet, thus scaling Ethereum.
* Cryptographic consulting: I advised teams across ConsenSys, including the MetaMask team, about cryptography and security.


# Ethereum Engineering Group Meet-up (December 2017 to Present): Organiser & Speaker
The [Ethereum Engineering Group Meet-up](https://www.meetup.com/ethereum-engineering/) is a group that meets via Zoom each week or two. We have speakers from all over the world who deliver talks on Solidity, the Ethereum platform, cryptography, crosschain & bridges, applications, law, social aspects of blockchain, and much more. All talks are recorded and appear on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2iGGbbKzS2hYwcZ9xBS-6A). Talks commonly have hundreds to thousands of views, with the [most viewed talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxL_1AfV7N4) currently having 32K views. I am the driving force behind the group, and have personally delivered more than a dozen talks. 


# Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre: (July 2022 â€“ Present): Advisor
I provide advice to Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) on crosschain protocols and Solidity contracts.


# Multiple Projects: Advisor: (2016 - Present):
I am an advisor on multiple projects. I give guidance and am a sounding board for ideas on varied topics including: DeFi, crosschain, blockchain, cryptography, protocol design, development process, leadership, management, and recruitment. The projects range in maturity, though most are early stage / stealth.
